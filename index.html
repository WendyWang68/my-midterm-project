    <p>Alaska is a state located in the western United States on the northwest extremity of North America. A semi-exclave of the U.S., it borders the Canadian province of British Columbia and the territory of Yukon to the east and shares a maritime border with the Russian Federation's Chukotka Autonomous Okrug to the west, just across the Bering Strait. To the north are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas of the Arctic Ocean, while the Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest.</p>
    <p>Alaska is by far the largest U.S. state by area, comprising more total area than the next three largest states (Texas, California, and Montana) combined. It represents the seventh largest subnational division in the world. It is the third-least populous and the most sparsely populated state, but by far the continent's most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel, with a population of 736,081 as of 2020â€”more than quadruple the combined populations of Northern Canada and Greenland. Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. The state capital of Juneau is the second-largest city in the United States by area, comprising more territory than the states of Rhode Island and Delaware. The former capital of Alaska, Sitka, is the largest U.S. city by area.</p>

    <p class="poem">Poem "Alaska"</p>
    <h2>by Sabrina Blakley</h2>
    <p>I always like winter best. <br>
Windy and rainy, <br>
It appears to never rest. </p>
    <p>See the water fall beside, <br>
This dark, hidden road, <br>
Far from the calm ocean tide. </p>
    <p>This is a beautiful land, <br>
Frozen within ice, <br>
Where the great trees strongly stand.</p>
    <p>Beyond the town of Skagway, <br>
Gates to the Klondike, <br>
Where peace seems to always stay. </p>
   <p>Saw-tooth peaks point to the sky, <br>
Tall and majestic, <br>
Where nature's great secrets lie. </p>
   <p>Resting on the pointy peaks, <br>
Sleep the white glaciers, <br>
I can hear the Tlingits speak. </p>
   <p>This is where my worries flee, <br>
In great Alaska, <br>
Where my heart will always be. </p>
