    <h2>Santa Claus</h2>
    <p>Santa Claus is here waiting for you! You can visit the house of Santa Claus here in North Pole. Christmas theme is all year round here. The No.1 Santa Claus Lane flag is a great spot to take wonderful pictures with your family. </p>
    <p>The most popular offering, though, is the Letter from Santa, a tradition that’s been around since 1952. Every Christmas, the Santa Claus House receives hundreds of thousands of letters from children around the world. During your visit, you can order a letter sent to your child or grandchild. Each letter includes a note on stationery (unchanged since the 1960s), a Santa Claus dollar, a photo of Santa, and a sticker reading “I’m on Santa’s Good List.” You can even purchase the deed to one square inch of the North Pole.</p>
    <p>Visitors come as much for the experience as the shopping. There are parades and fundraisers like “Jingle in July” or “Cruising with Santa.” Even if there’s not a special event happening during your visit, there’s always plenty going on. Have your photo taken with Santa, or take pictures beside the 50-foot tall Santa statue. You’ll also find holiday murals that cover the building, a giant sled, and even a short walking path through the woods.</p>

    <h2>Wild Animals</h2>
    <p>Polar bears are in North Pole. It is their home. In the winter, polar bears in Alaska are found as far south as St. Lawrence Island and occasionally move down to St. Matthew Island and the Kuskokwim Delta. In the summer, bears are most abundant around the edge of the pack ice in the Chukchi Sea and Arctic Ocean.</p>
    <p>Polar bears’ seasonal movements are driven by regional ice dynamics and can be quite extensive. Most polar bears remain with the pack ice as it recedes north during the summer melting season; however, along Alaska’s Beaufort Sea coast, some polar bears also come on land to rest until shore-fast ice begins to develop along the coast in late fall and the pack ice advances south, once again providing them with a suitable platform for hunting seals.</p>
