    <h1>Fairbanks</h1>
    <p class="myDiv5">Fairbanks is a home rule city and the borough seat of the Fairbanks North Star Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska. Fairbanks is the largest and coldest city in the Interior region of Alaska and the second largest in the state. Fairbanks’ climate is classified as humid continental (Köppen Dfb) closely bordering on a subarctic climate (Dfc), with long cold winters and short warm summers. October through February are the snowiest months, and snow is limited from March to May. On average, the season's first accumulating snowfall and first inch of snow fall on October 1 and October 11, respectively; the average last inch and last accumulating snowfall are respectively on March 29 and April 15, though it does flurry in May in some years.</p>
    <h2>Magical Aurora</h2>

      <p>Fairbanks' Aurora Season is from August 21 to April 21 and the aurora will be visible in Fairbanks an average of four out of five nights when the sky is clear and dark enough. Scientifically speaking, the aurora is dancing above year-round, but we can only see it during the Aurora Season when we have dark enough skies.</p>
      <p>The northern lights, also known as aurora borealis, occur about 60 or 70 miles above the earth’s surface — about 10 times higher than a jet aircraft flies — and can extend hundreds of miles into space. Electrically charged particles traveling through the earth’s magnetosphere collide with gasses, creating energy in the form of light. The intensity of solar flares varies the intensity and extent of activity within the Auroral oval, the ring-like area above the geomagnetic north where auroral activity is concentrated. The most common color displayed is a brilliant yellow-green, but the aurora borealis can also produce red, blue, and purple patterns.</p>
      <p>Take a picture with your loved one under the beautiful aurora. Make a good wish under the aurora. It will definitely bring you with good luck!</p>

    <h2>Dog Sledding</h2>

    <p>Do you love dogs? Alaska has cute Haskies. You can take a ride from the top of the snow mountain to the ground. It will be a very special ride that you have ever experienced. You can also feel the joyful speed when the dog runs all the way on the slope.</p>
    <p>You're speeding through Alaskan forest, sitting on a sled that's being pulled by some of Alaska's most powerful creatures. This is dog sledding—and it's not only an Alaskan tradition, but also a state obsession, one that's celebrated every March with the running of the 1,150-mile Iditarod Sled Dog Race from Anchorage to Nome. Taking a dogsledding excursion is a chance to see what the fuss is all about. You'll meet Iditarod racers and their dogs and hear what it's like to run this brutal race. And often, you'll experience the thrill of dogsledding first-hand.</p>
    <p>In the late 1890’s and early 1900’s the Gold Rush brought many settlers to Alaska. They traveled by boat to the coastal towns of Seward and Knik, and from there travelled by land to the gold fields. The trail that they used was named The Iditarod Trail, and in winter it was only accessible by dog teams; which started being used around 3,000 years ago, when humans first migrated north of the Arctic Circle. The Iditarod has continued to grow over the last few decades, achieving name-recognition around the world and even spin-off races! The original race still ends in Nome, where mushers pass the notorious historical saloons, then through the archway that marks the finish line, where a crowd cheers on every single musher, no matter what time they come in.</p>

    <h2>Arctic Circle</h2>

      <p>Close to Fairbanks, there is the famous Arctic Circle sign in the Arctic. This region is the coldest place in Alaska. Take a helicopter to explore this beautiful place with snows and ices.</p>
      <p>Arctic Circle, parallel, or line of latitude around the Earth, at approximately 66°30′ N. Because of the Earth’s inclination of about 23 1/2° to the vertical, it marks the southern limit of the area within which, for one day or more each year, the Sun does not set (about June 21) or rise (about December 21). The length of continuous day or night increases northward from one day on the Arctic Circle to six months at the North Pole. The Antarctic Circle is the southern counterpart of the Arctic Circle, where on any given date conditions of daylight or darkness are exactly opposite.</p>
